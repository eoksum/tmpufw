time to live. You can then run the script as a cronjob (with the --clean flag)
to clean up (remove) the expired rules.

    -s, --status                     show rule list with expirations
    -c, --clean                      clean up expired rules
    -r RULE, --rule RULE             rule to be added to `ufw`
    -p POSITION, --position POSITION position to add the rule
    -t TTL, --ttl TTL                time to live for the rule
